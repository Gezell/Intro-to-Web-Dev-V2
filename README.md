# HTML
## Tags
- `script` - brings in JS (Java Script) onto the page 
  - goes in the body of the page 
# CSS
## The Box Model
- Display
  - `inline` use this to get any tag to display like inline text
 # JavaScript
 ## Vocab 
 - booleans: Simple true or false statements, used everywhere
   - Santax 
    - true or false
 - const: delcaring a constant. 
   - no spaces
   - can not be changed (see `let`)
 - Control Flow: fancy term for thesuing if and for loops and similar item.
 - Control Variable: This is the `i` or `j` term that is used in a for loop.
 - Index: this is the spot in the matrix that an item is occupying
  - For example, given string `0,1,2,3,4,5` index 4 has a value of 3. As an alternate example, given string `1,2,3,4,5,6` index 4 has a value of 4. 
 - Keyword: commands to start off the line letting javascript know there is an item coming. 
 - Let: delcaring a variable 
   - no spaces
   - this is a true variable, see `const` for constants
 - Number: There is just one kind of number for JS no need to worry about other types like float or otherwise.
 - var: this is an old version of `let`, this is not used anymore. 
 
 
 
 ## General Advice
 - Use as many variables as possible 
 - "Principle of least power" - always chose the least pwerful "thing" to accomplish whaterver you're trying to do. 
 - In coding, counting goes from 0 up not from 1 (see `index` in vocab)
 ## Commands used in Toutorial
 -  `console.log()` - this logs whatever you put in the function to the JS command console.
 - `for (let i = 0; i <=10; i++) {...}` run the code inside the parens for eleven cycles.
   - `let i = 0; - this is defining the control variable
   - `i <= 10; - this is detting a while loop type restriction
   - `i++` - increments the control variable every time the code whithin the loop runs.
 ## Santax Points likley to be useful
 - strings can include variable with the following 
   - `Hello ${variableOne} ${variableTwo}! How are you?`
     -This will create a string with the variables plugged into the exact location of the ${...}'s meaning that any spaces included are useful
 - = means *is assigned to*
 - == means something similar to tripple equals but different
 - === means *is this equal to that*
 - !== means *is this NOT equal to that*
 - greater than, greater than or equal to, or vice versa act as expected
   - >= or <=
### Incrementing shortcuts
  - All four of these lines are equivilant  
    - `friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;`
    - `friendsAtYourParty += 1;`
     - This can also be edited to include any number after the `+=`
     - also works with the other operators
      - `**=` is exponent
    - `friendsAtYourParty++;`
    - `++friendsAtYourParty;`
     - don't use this one, people thinkit's weird
