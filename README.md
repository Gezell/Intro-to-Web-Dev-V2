 ## General Advice
 - Use as many variables as possible 
 - "Principle of least power" - always chose the least pwerful "thing" to accomplish whaterver you're trying to do. 
 ## Commands used in Toutorial
 -  `console.log()` - this logs whatever you put in the function to the JS command console.
 ## Santax Points likley to be useful
 - strings can include variable with the following 
   - `Hello ${variableOne} ${variableTwo}! How are you?`
     -This will create a string with the variables plugged into the exact location of the ${...}'s meaning that any spaces included are useful
 - = means *is assigned to*
 - == means something similar to tripple equals but different
 - === means *is this equal to that*
 - !== means *is this NOT equal to that*
 - greater than, greater than or equal to, or vice versa act as expected
   - >= or <=
### Incrementing shortcuts
